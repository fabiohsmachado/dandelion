"""A bijective linear time coding and decoding for k-trees

This package presents a method for coding and decoding k-Trees from strings
called Generalized Dandelion Code.

It is an implemetentation of the algorithm describe in Camintini's et. al.
paper
[[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225969891_Bijective_Linear_Time_Coding_and_Decoding_for_k-Trees][Bijective
Linear Coding and Decoding for k-Trees]].

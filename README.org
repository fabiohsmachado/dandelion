* Introduction
This package presents a method for coding and decoding k-Trees from strings
called Generalized Dandelion Codes. It is an implemetentation of the algorithm
describe in Camintini's et. al. paper [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225969891_Bijective_Linear_Time_Coding_and_Decoding_for_k-Trees][Bijective Linear Coding and Decoding for
k-Trees]].

This documentation assumes familiarity with the mentioned paper.

* Code Structure
Here the Dandelion code is an Array of Tuples. The i-th Tuple has the
information about the parent of the i-th node and it's edge's label on the
characteristic tree. The \epsilon edge label in represented as the value $-1$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
validCode = [(0, -1), (2, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (1, 3), (5, 3)]; #OK
invalidCode = [(0, -1), (0, 2), 4, [1, 3]] #NOK, has an int and an array instead of Tuples in its elements
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

To code and decode a k-Tree an instance of the Dandelion class must be created.
When instatiating the class the number of variables $N$ and the width of the $k$
tree must be provided. In case of decoding a code must also be provided at
construction time or later by setting the "code" attribute to a valid code. If a
wrong code (bad forming or wrong length accordind to N or k) is provided, an
Exception is raised.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :results output
  from dandelion.main import Dandelion

  N = 11; #Number of variables in the k-tree
  k = 3; #Width of the tree

  dandelionCode = Dandelion(11, 3, validCode); #OK, code provided at construction
  dandelionCode = Dandelion(11, 3); #OK, empty structure
  try:
      dandelionCode.code = invalidCode; #NOK, raises AssertionError exception
  except AssertionError as e:
      print("Error");
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 
: >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> >>> ... ... ... ... Error
